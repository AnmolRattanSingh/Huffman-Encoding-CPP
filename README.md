# Huffman-Encoding-CPP
Huffman Encoding implementation in CPP


We aim to implement the Huffman coding algorithm in C++ to compress and decompress data efficiently. Huffman coding is a widely used technique in data compression, and this project aims to demonstrate a solid understanding of the algorithm's principles and its practical application.
